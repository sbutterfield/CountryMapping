{"body":"#Simple Country Mapping application for Force.com\r\n\r\n##Introduction\r\nThis application is focused on a simplified approach towards mapping country keyword text and patterns to a configurable standardized format:\r\n\r\n- ISO 3166-1 alpha-2\r\n- ISO 3166-1 alpha-3\r\n- ISO 3166-1 numeric\r\n- FIPS 10-4 alpha-2\r\n\r\nThe application uses a system of two related objects to manage keyword to value relational mapping. It uses highly optimized algorithms to account for I/O normaliztion and mis-spellings.\r\n\r\n##License\r\nThis is free software, but I sincerely hope that you show credit and maintain the open license if you decide to use this in a project or use concepts derrived from it.\r\nIf you do make improvements to the software, I hope that you will create a pull request so that those improvements can be merged and used for the benefit of everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Here are the installation links:\r\nManaged:  \r\nUn-managed:  \r\n\r\n##Set-up and Use\r\n\r\n###Object-model Glossary\r\n\r\n    Standardized_Country__c\r\nParent object to Country_Descriptor__c containing indexed fields of standardized country representations.\r\n\r\n    Country_Descriptor__c\r\nChild object to Standardized_Country__c containing an indexed descriptor field used to represent any valid input pattern which could represent it's Standardized_Country__c parent.\r\n\r\n    global virtual CountryMapping{}\r\nApex wrapper object used for parsing and combined representation of a matched and mapped keyword-->standardized country format. This class was made virtual to support overrides in managed package environments.\r\n\r\n    global virtual RuntimeState{}\r\nApex object that is initialized and used at the opening of each runtime to maintain a description of this applications stateful presence and operating order throughout mult-context runtimes. This class was made virtual to support overrides in managed package environments.\r\n\r\n###Installation Routine\r\nUsually this application's security controls will limit use and visibility only to administrators and/or operations users. Follow the typical set-up routine and you should be fine.\r\n\r\nUpon installing a packaged version of this application, a post-installation script will execute and pre-populate the Standardized_Country__c, and Country_Descriptor__c child-object with 'out-of-the-box' data.\r\nThe script will populate a new Standardized_Country__c row for each unique:\r\n- ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (ex: US)\r\n- ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 (ex: USA)\r\n- ISO 3166-1 numeric (ex: 840)\r\n\r\nThe script will then populate a new Country_Descriptor__c row for each Standardized_Country__c with it's generally accepted, normalized text descriptor:\r\n- Descriptor (ex: United States)\r\n\r\nOnce the installation script finishes successfully, it will notify the installing Adminstrator via e-mail.\r\n\r\n_Note:_  \r\n>To acquire and load the FIPS mapping for Standardized_Country__c records, I suggest manually loading the mapping from:\r\n>http://opengeocode.org/download/fips2iso.txt\r\n\r\n>For a comprehensive mapping file, including multi-lingual standardization:  \r\n>http://opengeocode.org/download/countrynames.txt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Configuration, tuning and usage\r\nThe application contains triggers for Lead, Contact and Account standard SObjects. When a record gets inserted or updated, these triggers will fire and attempt to map a non-standardized value to a standardized one.\r\n\r\nYou must start by telling the application which standardized value you want to use. Country Mapping uses a public configuration setting to control both application behavior and standardization settings. You are allowed to turn individual triggers on-or-off, control literal text matching or allow for fuzzing matching which accounts for mis-spellings, and finally tune the weight for a fuzzy match.\r\n\r\n_Note:_  \r\n>You can also create your own triggers and/or batch classes and reference a helper class which calls to global method signature:\r\n\r\n    CountryTriggerHelper.getCountryMapping(String input)\r\n>and retreives the appropriate country mapping from an `input` country string.\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
