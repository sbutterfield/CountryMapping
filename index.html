        <h1>Simple Country Mapping application for Force.com</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This application is focused on a simplified approach towards mapping country keyword text and patterns to a configurable standardized format:</p>

<ul>
<li>ISO 3166-1 alpha-2</li>
<li>ISO 3166-1 alpha-3</li>
<li>ISO 3166-1 numeric</li>
<li>FIPS 10-4 alpha-2</li>
</ul><p>The application uses a system of two related objects to manage keyword to value relational mapping. It uses highly optimized algorithms to account for I/O normaliztion and mis-spellings.</p>

<h2>AppExchange</h2>

<p>Country Mapping application is distributed as both a managed and un-managed 'apex certified' package. Here are the installation links:
Managed:<br>
Un-managed:  </p>

<h2>Set-up and Use</h2>

<h3>Object-model Glossary</h3>

<pre><code>Standardized_Country__c
</code></pre>

<p>Parent object to Country_Descriptor__c containing indexed fields of standardized country representations.</p>

<pre><code>Country_Descriptor__c
</code></pre>

<p>Child object to Standardized_Country__c containing an indexed descriptor field used to represent any valid input pattern which could represent it's Standardized_Country__c parent.</p>

<pre><code>global virtual CountryMapping{}
</code></pre>

<p>Apex wrapper object used for parsing and combined representation of a matched and mapped keyword--&gt;standardized country format. This class was made virtual to support overrides in managed package environments.</p>

<pre><code>global virtual RuntimeState{}
</code></pre>

<p>Apex object that is initialized and used at the opening of each runtime to maintain a description of this applications stateful presence and operating order throughout mult-context runtimes. This class was made virtual to support overrides in managed package environments.</p>

<h3>Installation Routine</h3>

<p>Usually this application's security controls will limit use and visibility only to administrators and/or operations users. Follow the typical set-up routine and you should be fine.</p>

<p>Upon installing a packaged version of this application, a post-installation script will execute and pre-populate the Standardized_Country__c, and Country_Descriptor__c child-object with 'out-of-the-box' data.
The script will populate a new Standardized_Country__c row for each unique:</p>

<ul>
<li>ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (ex: US)</li>
<li>ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 (ex: USA)</li>
<li>ISO 3166-1 numeric (ex: 840)</li>
</ul><p>The script will then populate a new Country_Descriptor__c row for each Standardized_Country__c with it's generally accepted, normalized text descriptor:</p>

<ul>
<li>Descriptor (ex: United States)</li>
</ul><p>Once the installation script finishes successfully, it will notify the installing Adminstrator via e-mail.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To acquire and load the FIPS mapping for Standardized_Country__c records, I suggest manually loading the mapping from:
<a href="http://opengeocode.org/download/fips2iso.txt">http://opengeocode.org/download/fips2iso.txt</a></p>

<p>For a comprehensive mapping file, including multi-lingual standardization:<br><a href="http://opengeocode.org/download/countrynames.txt">http://opengeocode.org/download/countrynames.txt</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Configuration, tuning and usage</h3>

<p>The application contains triggers for Lead, Contact and Account standard SObjects. When a record gets inserted or updated, these triggers will fire and attempt to map a non-standardized value to a standardized one.</p>

<p>You must start by telling the application which standardized value you want to use. Country Mapping uses a public configuration setting to control both application behavior and standardization settings. You are allowed to turn individual triggers on-or-off, control literal text matching or allow for fuzzing matching which accounts for mis-spellings, and finally tune the weight for a fuzzy match.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can also create your own triggers and/or batch classes and reference a helper class which calls to global method signature:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>CountryTriggerHelper.getCountryMapping(String input)
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>and retreives the appropriate country mapping from an <code>input</code> country string.</p>
