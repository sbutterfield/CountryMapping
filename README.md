#Simple Country Mapping application for Force.com

##Introduction
This application is focused on a simplified approach towards mapping country keyword text and patterns to a configurable standardized format:

- ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
- ISO 3166-1 alpha-3
- ISO 3166-1 numeric
- FIPS 10-4 alpha-2

The application uses a system of two related objects to manage keyword to value relational mapping. It uses highly optimized algorithms to account for I/O normaliztion and mis-spellings.
